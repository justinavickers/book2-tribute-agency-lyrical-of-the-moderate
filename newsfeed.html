                    Leslie Edward Claypool (born September 29, 1963) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, composer, 
                    author and actor best known as the bassist and lead vocalist of the band Primus. Claypool's playing style 
                    on the electric bass mixes tapping, flamenco-like strumming, whammy bar bends, and slapping.
                    Claypool has also self-produced and engineered his solo releases from his own studio, "Rancho Relaxo". 
                     2006 saw the release of a full-length feature film Electric Apricot written and directed by Claypool as 
                    well as a debut novel South of the Pumphouse.
                    Claypool wrote the theme songs for the Adult Swim animated television series Robot Chicken and South Park.
                    Earlier this year, Les Claypool told his pans that during their The Desaturating Seven tour, this may be the last time
                    the Primus band tour for a while. But, he has released a book on the history of his band, "Primus".

            <div class="card">
                    <p>Lars Ulrich interviewed PRIMUS frontman Les Claypool on for the October 1 episode of "It's Electric!", 
                        the METALLICA drummer's online radio show on Apple Music's Beats 1. During the chat, Les talked about auditioning 
                        for the then-vacant bassist slot in METALLICA following the September 1986 death of the group's previous bassist, 
                        Cliff Burton.

                    "I got invited down," Les said. "It was a very honorable thing to be able to come down and play 
                    with my old buddy Kirk Hammett and the METALLICA guys. And I learned a couple of tunes, and I brought my bass banjo, 
                    'cause I figured, 'Hey, this will work great with METALLICA.' So we all get in this room, it was a control room, and 
                    there's a there's a glass just like that, and Lars is on the other side of it. And he's, like, 'I can't hear James 
                    [Hetfield]. I can't hear James. I can't see James.' They're, like, 'Well, we don't know what to do. We can't fit you 
                    in the room.' [And Lars told them] 'Take the glass out.' And we all kind of chuckled, 'Hahahah.' 'Take the glass out.'
                    Guys came in and removed the glass from the studio. Brain was actually playing in PRIMUS at that point in time. 
                    And I said, 'Dude, Lars couldn't see James, so he had the glass removed.' And Brain is, like, 'Dude! You've gotta be
                    kidding me! That's so heavy! That's unbelievable, man! He removed the glass! Oh my god!' But he just thought that was 
                    the greatest thing he'd ever heard in his entire life."
